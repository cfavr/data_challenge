This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library("MatchIt")
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)

data <- read.csv('data/train.csv')
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), str_trim))
data$HIREDT <- mdy(data$HIREDT)
enddate <- as.Date("07/10/2023","%d/%m/%Y")
data$HIREDT  <- difftime(enddate,data$HIREDT ,units="days")
data$SEX = ifelse(data$SEX == "MALE", 1,0)
```
```{r}
subdata <- data[sample(nrow(data), 15000), ]
```

```{r}
m.out0 <- matchit(SEX ~ RACE + HIREDT + HRSWKD + JC.TITLE, data = data,
                 method = NULL, distance = "glm")
```

```{r}
summary(m.out0)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
